# Akhilesh “Akhi” Warty 👋

**AI / Machine Learning Engineer • Computer Vision • Data & Backend Systems**

I design and build **end-to-end ML systems** — from **training pipelines and evaluation** to **edge deployment and backend infrastructure**.  
My work focuses on **reliable, reproducible, and deployable ML**, especially for **computer vision and data-intensive applications**.

📍 Boston, MA  
🎯 Target roles: **AI/ML Engineer**, **Computer Vision Engineer**, **Data Engineer**, **Backend SWE**
